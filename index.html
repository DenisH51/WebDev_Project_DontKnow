            Introduction
        </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        The last dinosaurs became extinct, or died out, about 65.5 million years ago. Fossils of dinosaurs were first discovered in the early 1800s. Fossils are remains or impressions of a plant or animal that have been preserved in rock. By studying these fossils, scientists know that dinosaurs were the ancient cousins of today’s crocodiles, snakes, and lizards. Scientists also believe that today’s birds descended from dinosaurs.

            When and Where Dinosaurs Lived
        </h2>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The study of the history and physical features of Earth is called geology. Earth began forming about 4.6 billion years ago. Earth underwent many changes from then until the present. Geologists call this vast time period geologic time. They break geologic time into smaller time periods. Dinosaurs lived from about 245 to 65.5 million years ago. They were common during the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous geologic time periods. Not all species, or types, of dinosaur lived at the same time. They also did not all become extinct at the same time. They died out gradually.

    <p>
        Dinosaurs lived throughout the world, and their fossils have been found on every continent. They lived in all different kinds of environments as well, ranging from tropical forests to dry, sandy deserts.

            Physical Features and Behavior
        </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        Dinosaurs were different sizes. Some dinosaurs were smaller than a chicken. Others weighed as much as 100 tons—more than 10 times as much as the largest elephants.
    </p>
    <p>
            Dinosaurs did not have any hair. Their skin had a bumpy or pebbly surface. Some scientists believe that dinosaurs were gray or green in color. These colors would have helped the dinosaurs blend in with their surroundings. Other scientists think that dinosaurs were very colorful. Bright colors would have helped males get the attention of females.

            Some species of dinosaurs

        <h3>
            Ornithischian Dinosaurs
        </h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        The ornithischians had hips shaped like the hips of today’s birds. Despite this similarity, however, today’s birds are not related to the ornithischians.
    </p>

    <p>
           The ornithischians were plant eaters. They walked on either two or four thick, sturdy legs. Ornithischians generally had flat teeth to grind tough plants. They also had an extra bone at the tip of the lower jaw. This bone joined the two halves of the lower jaw together. It also helped to form a horny beak that made it easier for the dinosaurs to bite plants.

        <h3>
            Saurischian Dinosaurs
        </h3>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The saurischians had hips that look like the hips of today’s reptiles. But they also had some features in common with today’s birds. In fact, scientists believe that the saurischians are more closely related to birds than to some other dinosaurs. The earliest bird, Archaeopteryx, was a saurischian. The saurischians are divided into the meat-eating theropods and the plant-eating sauropods.

        <h3>
            Theropods
        </h3>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The theropods include all the meat-eating dinosaurs. Among them is the fierce Tyrannosaurus rex, which weighed as much as eight tons. Giganotosaurus and Spinosaurus were even larger. Theropods walked on their two back legs. Most of them were built to hunt. They used their short front arms to catch and tear prey. Their fingers and toes had long, sharp claws. They had powerful jaws and sharp teeth for tearing flesh.
